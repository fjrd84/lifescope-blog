Sources' reliability
--------------------
As very different types of information are involved, both from non-specialized and specialized sources, we must explore each source’s reliability.

| Source name | Source type | Reliability |
|:--------------------------|:------------------|:---------------|
| PubMed | Medical database | Highest |
| Clinical Trials | Medical database | Highest |
| Institution | Twitter | Very reliable |
| Academia | Twitter | Very reliable |
| Publishing source | Twitter | Very reliable |
| Doctor | Twitter | Very reliable |
| Professional | Twitter | Less reliable |
| Medical business | Twitter | Less reliable |
| Interested in healthcare | Twitter | Less reliable |
| News source | Twitter | Less reliable |
| Healthcare initiative | Twitter | Less reliable |
| Association | Twitter | Less reliable |
| Generic | Twitter | Less reliable |

We made a simple but effective reliability scale to categorize the sources being used. As you can see, medical databases are at the top of the scale, whereas a social network like Twitter holds a lower position. **We manually evaluated the user profiles' reliability on the 1023 test messages** that were used in the [algorithm's confidence assessment](/confidence/).
