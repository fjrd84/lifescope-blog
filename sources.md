Data sources
------------

Our application and the returned datasets are based on different health information sources. Currently, the Lifescopeâ€™s algorithm receives and analyzes data from a live source like **Twitter**, and open-source medical databases such as **PubMed** or **ClinicalTrials** (we expect to add more in the future).

Lifescope is programmed with a Twitter stream listener receiving a constant input of health data, as you can see in our application timeline.

In addition, our platform connects to specialized databases like [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and [Clinical Trials](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov) through RSS feeds.

We periodically receive **RSS feeds** from these websites with up-to-date **medical articles' metadata**, which provide very valuable medical research headlines and hyperlinks.
