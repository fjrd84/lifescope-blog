Twitter's user profile categories
---------------------------------
As for Twitter, our algorithm was trained to return different reliability levels within a community of users providing healthcare information. For this reason, a key component of Lifescope is the **Twitter user profile analyzer**. It captures the most health-related profiles, and then assigns a category to each profile.

By using this system of categories, we expect to have lesser chances of receiving inputs from non-health (and non-wanted) related users. And yet, we can continue making a distinction among the incoming health-related users, as **the algorithm distinguishes different health-related profiles**.

The following is a list of the 11 user profiles categorized by the algorithm, together with a definition and an example for each one (all these profiles are publicly available in Twitter).
